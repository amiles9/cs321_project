# Very Serious Readme

## Getting started
Go to the directory you want to add the repo to
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amiles9/cs321_project
```

First, create a file and then track it via
```bash
git add FILE_NAME
```

Make a local commit
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"

# We can automatically stage files (thereby avoiding adding if we include the -a flag
git commit -am "Commit message"
```

Push it to the repo
```bash
# Try this version of push first
git push -u origin main
```
